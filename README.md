# Fractal-Decision-Tree

This repository combines fractal-based impurity measures for decision trees with pruning techniques to improve model generalization and performance. The impurity measures leverage fractal dimensions and expansion rules for feature selection and tree construction, while the pruning methods focus on reducing overfitting and improving the tree's predictive power. The repository provides implementations for decision trees with fractal impurity measures and includes pruning algorithms for enhanced model optimization.

Key Features:

    Fractal-based impurity measures for decision trees with feature selection.
    Implementation of decision tree pruning techniques to improve model generalization.
    Explanation of fractal dimensions, expansion rules, and pruning methods.
